<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>

<h3>THE LITTLE COLOUR GRINDER</h3>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 81px;">
<img src="images/drop_i.png" width="81" height="125" alt="I" title="" />
</div><div class='unindent'><br /><br />T was a bright morning
of early April, many
hundred years ago; and
through all the fields and
meadows of Normandy the violets
and cuckoo-buds were just
beginning to peep through the
tender green of the young grass.
The rows of tall poplar-trees that
everywhere, instead of fences,
served to mark off the farms of
the country folk, waved in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
spring wind like great, pale green
plumes; and among their branches
the earliest robins and field-fares
were gaily singing as a little boy
stepped out from a small thatched
cottage standing among the fields,
and took his way along the highroad.</div>

<p>That Gabriel Viaud was a
peasant lad, any one could have
told from the blouse of blue
homespun, and the wooden shoes
which he wore; and that he felt
the gladness of the April time
could easily be known by the
happy little song he began to sing
to himself, and by the eager delight
with which he now and then
stooped to pluck a blue violet or
to gather a handful of golden
cuckoo-buds.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span></p>

<p>A mile or two behind him, and
hidden by a bend in the road, lay
the little village of St. Martin-de-Bouchage;
while in the soft
blue distance ahead of him rose
the gray walls of St. Martin's
Abbey, whither he was going.</p>

<p>Indeed, for almost a year now
the little boy had been trudging
every day to the Abbey, where
he earned a small sum by waiting
upon the good brothers who
dwelt there, and who made the
beautiful painted books for which
the Abbey had become famous.
Gabriel could grind and mix their
colours for them, and prepare the
parchment on which they did
their writing, and could do many
other little things that helped
them in their work.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span></p>

<p>The lad enjoyed his tasks at
the Abbey, and, above all, delighted
in seeing the beautiful
things at which the brothers were
always busy; yet, as he now drew
near the gateway, he could not
help but give a little sigh, for it
was so bright and sunny out-of-doors.
He smiled, though, as he
looked at the gay bunches of
blossoms with which he had quite
filled his hands, and felt that at
least he was taking a bit of the
April in with him, as he crossed
the threshold and entered a large
room.</p>

<p>"Good morrow, Gabriel," called
out several voices as he came in,
for the lad was a general favourite
with the brothers; and Gabriel,
respectfully taking off his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
blue peasant cap, gave a pleasant
"good morrow" to each.</p>

<p>The room in which he stood
had plain stone walls and a floor
of paved stone, and little furniture,
except a number of solidly
made benches and tables. These
were placed beneath a row of high
windows, and the tables were covered
with writing and painting
materials and pieces of parchment;
for the brotherhood of St.
Martin's was very industrious.</p>

<p>In those days,&mdash;it was four
hundred years ago,&mdash;printed
books were very few, and almost
unknown to most people; for
printing-presses had been invented
only a few years, and so by far
the greater number of books in
the world were still made by the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
patient labour of skilful hands;
the work usually being done by
the monks, of whom there were
very many at that time.</p>

<p>These monks, or brothers, as
they were often called, lived in
monasteries and abbeys, and were
men who banded themselves together
in brotherhoods, taking
solemn vows never to have homes
of their own or to mingle in the
daily life of others, but to devote
their lives to religion; for they
believed that they could serve
God better by thus shutting themselves
off from the world.</p>

<p>And so it came about that
the brothers, having more time
and more learning than most
other people of those days, made
it their chief work to preserve<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
and multiply all the books that
were worth keeping. These they
wrote out on parchment (for paper
was very scarce so long ago), and
then ornamented the pages with
such beautiful painted borders of
flowers and birds and saints and
angels, and such lovely initial
letters, all in bright colours and
gold, that to this day large numbers
of the beautiful books made
by the monks are still kept among
the choicest treasures of the museums
and great libraries of the
world.</p>

<p>And few of all those wonderful
old illuminations (for so the
painted ornaments were called)
were lovelier than the work of the
brotherhood of St. Martin's. Gabriel
felt very proud even to grind<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
the colours for them. But as he
passed over to one of the tables
and began to make ready his
paint mortar, the monk who had
charge of the writing-room called
to him, saying:</p>

<p>"Gabriel, do not get out thy
work here, for the Abbot hath
just ordered that some one must
help Brother Stephen, who is
alone in the old chapter-house.
He hath a special book to make,
and his colour-grinder is fallen
ill; so go thou at once and take
Jacques's place."</p>

<p>So Gabriel left the writing-room
and passed down the long
corridor that led to the chapter-house.
This was a room the
brothers had kept for years as a
meeting-place, when they and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
Abbot, who governed them all,
wished to talk over the affairs of
the Abbey; but as it had at last
grown too small for them, they
had built a new and larger one;
and so the old chapter-house was
seldom used any more.</p>

<p>Gabriel knew this, and he wondered
much why Brother Stephen
chose to work there rather
than in the regular writing-room
with the others. He supposed,
however, that, for some reason of
his own, Brother Stephen preferred
to be alone.</p>

<p>He did not know that the
monk, at that moment, was sitting
moodily by his work-table, his
eyes staring aimlessly ahead of
him, and his hands dropped idly
in his lap. For Brother Stephen<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
was feeling very cross and unhappy
and out of sorts with all
the world. And this was the reason:
poor Brother Stephen had
entered the Abbey when a lad
scarcely older than Gabriel. He
had come of good family, but had
been left an orphan with no one
to care for him, and for want of
other home had been sent to
the Abbey, to be trained for
the brotherhood; for in those
days there were few places
where fatherless and motherless
children could be taken care
of.</p>

<p>As little Jean (for this was his
name before he joined the monks,
when one's own name was always
changed) grew up, he took the
solemn vows which bound him to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
the rules of the brotherhood without
realizing what it all would
mean to him; for Brother Stephen
was a born artist; and, by
and by, he began to feel that
while life in the Abbey was well
for most of the brothers, for him
it was not well. He wanted to
be free to wander about the world;
to paint pictures of many things;
and to go from city to city, and
see and study the work of the
world's great artists.</p>

<p>It is true he spent the greater
part of his time in the Abbey
working on the illuminated books,
and this he loved; yet it did not
wholly satisfy him. He longed
to paint other things, and, above
all, his artist nature longed for
freedom from all the little rules<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
of daily life that governed the
days of the brotherhood.</p>

<p>Brother Stephen had brooded
much over this desire for freedom,
and only the day before had
sought out the Abbot of St.
Martin's and asked to be released
from the vows of obedience which
he had taken years before, but
which now he found so hard to
live up to. But, to his great disappointment,
the Abbot had refused
to grant his request.</p>

<p>The Abbot had several reasons
for this refusal; one of them was
that he himself dearly loved all
the little daily ceremonies of the
Abbey, and he could not understand
why any one who had once
lived there could prefer a life in
the world. He really thought it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
was for Brother Stephen's own
good that he should stay in the
brotherhood.</p>

<p>And then, too, perhaps there
was another reason less to the
Abbot's credit; and this reason
was that of all the beautiful illuminated
books for which the
Abbey of St. Martin's had become
so famous, none were quite
so exquisitely done as those made
by Brother Stephen. So perhaps
the Abbot did not wish to
lose so skilful an artist from
the work-room of the Abbey,
and especially at this particular
time. For just before Brother
Stephen had had his talk with
the Abbot, a messenger from the
city of Paris had come to the
Abbey, bearing an order from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
the king, Louis XII., who
reigned over France, and Normandy
also, which was a part
of France.</p>

<p>Now the following winter, the
king was to wed the Lady Anne
of Bretagne; and as Lady Anne
was a great admirer and collector
of beautiful painted books,
the king thought no gift would
please his bride quite so much as
a piece of fine illumination; and
he decided that it should be an
hour book. These books were
so called because in them were
written different parts of the
Bible, intended to be read at certain
hours of the day; for most
people at that time were very
devout, and the great ladies especially
were very fond of having<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
their hour books made as beautiful
as possible.</p>

<p>As King Louis thought over
the best places where he might
have his bride's gift painted, at
last he made up his mind to send
to the monks of St. Martin's. He
commanded that the hour book be
done in the most beautiful style,
and that it must be finished by
the following December.</p>

<p>The Abbot was delighted with
the honour the king had shown
the Abbey in sending this order;
and he determined that Brother
Stephen should stay and make
the entire book, as no one else
wrote so evenly, or made quite
such lovely initials and borders as
did he.</p>

<p>When the Abbot told this to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
Brother Stephen, however, it was
a pity that he did so in such a
cold and haughty way that altogether
Brother Stephen's anger
was aroused, for he had a rather
unruly temper; and so, smarting
under the disappointment of not
receiving his liberty, and feeling
that the book for Lady Anne
was one cause of this, he had
spoken angrily and disrespectfully
to the Abbot, and refused point-blank
to touch the king's order.</p>

<p>At this the Abbot in his turn
became angry, and declared that
Brother Stephen should be compelled
to paint the hour book
whether he wished to or not; that
he must do it as punishment for
his unruly conduct; and the
Abbot threatened, moreover, that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
if he did not obey, he would be
placed under the ban of the
Church, which was considered by
all the brotherhood as a dreadful
misfortune.</p>

<p>And so with this threat hanging
over him, that very morning,
just before Gabriel reached the
Abbey, Brother Stephen had been
sent to the old chapter-house,
where he was ordered to work by
himself, and to begin the book at
once. And to complete his humiliation,
and for fear he might
try to run away, the Abbot caused
him to be chained to one of the
legs of the heavy work-table; and
this chain he was to wear every
day during working hours.</p>

<p>Now all this made Brother
Stephen very angry and unhappy,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
and his heart was full of bitterness
toward the Abbot and all of
the brotherhood and the world in
general, when all at once he heard
Gabriel's knock at the door; and
then, in another moment, the door
was softly pushed open, and there,
on the threshold, stood the little
boy.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<h3>BROTHER STEPHEN'S INSPIRATION</h3>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 86px;">
<img src="images/drop_g.png" width="86" height="125" alt="G" title="" />
</div><div class='unindent'><br /><br />ABRIEL knew nothing
of Brother Stephen's
troubles, and so was
smiling happily as he
stepped into the room, holding
his cap in one hand, while with
his other arm he hugged to him
his large bunch of violets and
cuckoo-buds. Indeed he looked
so bright and full of life that even
Brother Stephen felt the effect of
it, and his frown began to smooth
out a little as he said:</div>

<p>"Well, my lad, who art thou?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>"I am Gabriel Viaud, Brother
Stephen," answered the boy,
"and I have come to help you;
for they told me Jacques is fallen
ill. What would you like me to
do first?"</p>

<p>To this Brother Stephen
scarcely knew what to reply.
He was certainly in no mood for
work. He was still very, very
angry, and thought himself terribly
misused by the Abbot; and
though he greatly dreaded the
latter's threats, he had almost
reached the point of defying him
and the king and everybody else,
no matter what dreadful thing
happened to him afterward.</p>

<p>But then as he looked again at
the bright-faced little boy standing
there, and seeming so eager<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
to help, he began to relent more
and more; and besides, he found
it decidedly embarrassing to try
to explain things to Gabriel.</p>

<p>So after a little pause, he said
to him: "Gabriel, I am not ready
for thee at this moment; go sit
on yonder bench. I wish to
think out a matter which is perplexing
me." Then as Gabriel
obediently went over to the bench
and seated himself, he added:
"Thou canst pass the time looking
at the books on the shelf
above thee."</p>

<p>So while Brother Stephen was
trying to make up his mind as to
what he would do, Gabriel took
down one of the books, and was
soon absorbed in its pages. Presently,
as he turned a new one, he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
gave a little involuntary exclamation
of delight. At this Brother
Stephen noticed him, and&mdash;</p>

<p>"Ah!" he said, "what hast thou
found that seems to please thee?"</p>

<p>"Oh, sir," answered Gabriel,
"this is the most beautiful initial
letter I have ever seen!"</p>

<p>Now Gabriel did not know that
the book had been made a few
years before by Brother Stephen
himself, and so he had no idea
how much it pleased the brother
to have his work admired.</p>

<p>Indeed, most people who do
good work of any kind oftentimes
feel the need of praise; not flattery,
but the real approval of some
one who understands what they
are trying to do. It makes the
workman or artist feel that if his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
work is liked by somebody, it is
worth while to try to do more and
better.</p>

<p>Poor Brother Stephen did not
get much of this needed praise,
for many of the other monks at
the Abbey were envious of him,
and so were unwilling really to
admire his work; while the Abbot
was so cold and haughty and so
taken up with his own affairs, that
he seldom took the trouble to say
what he liked or disliked.</p>

<p>So when Brother Stephen saw
Gabriel's eager admiration, he felt
pleased indeed; for Gabriel had
a nice taste in artistic things, and
seemed instinctively to pick out
the best points of anything he
looked at. And when, in his enthusiasm,
he carried the book over<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
and began to tell Brother Stephen
why he so much admired the painting,
without knowing it, he really
made the latter feel happier than
he had felt for many a day. He
began to have a decided notion
that he would paint King Louis's
book after all. And just then, as
if to settle the matter, he happened
to glance at the corner of the table
where Gabriel had laid down his
bunch of flowers as he came
in.</p>

<p>It chanced that some of the
violets had fallen from the cluster
and dropped upon a broad ruler of
brass that lay beside the painting
materials. And even as Brother
Stephen looked, it chanced also
that a little white butterfly drifted
into the room through the bars of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
the high, open window; after
vaguely fluttering about for a
while, at last, attracted by the
blossoms, it came, and, poising
lightly over the violets on the
ruler, began to sip the honey from
the heart of one of them.</p>

<p>As Brother Stephen's artistic
eye took in the beauty of effect
made by the few flowers on the
brass ruler with the butterfly hovering
over them, he, too, gave a
little exclamation, and his eyes
brightened and he smiled; for he
had just got a new idea for an
illuminated border.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said to himself, "this
would be different from any I
have yet seen! I will decorate
King Louis's book with borders
of gold; and on the gold I will<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
paint the meadow wildflowers, and
the bees and butterflies, and all
the little flying creatures."</p>

<p>Now before this, all the borders
of the Abbey books had
been painted, in the usual manner
of the time, with scrolls and birds
and flowers more or less conventionalized;
that is, the artists did
not try to make them look exactly
like the real ones, but twisted
them about in all sorts of fantastic
ways. Sometimes the stem
of a flower would end in the
curled-up folds of a winged
dragon, or a bird would have
strange blossoms growing out of
his beak, or perhaps the tips of
his wings.</p>

<p>These borders were indeed exquisitely
beautiful, but Brother<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
Stephen was just tired of it all,
and wanted to do something quite
different; so he was delighted
with his new idea of painting the
field-flowers exactly like nature,
only placing them on a background
of gold.</p>

<p>As he pictured in his mind one
page after another thus adorned,
he became more and more interested
and impatient to begin at
once. He forgot all about his
anger at the Abbot; he forgot
everything else, except that he
wanted to begin King Louis's
book as quickly as possible!</p>

<p>And so he called briskly to
Gabriel, who meantime had reseated
himself on his bench:</p>

<p>"Gabriel, come hither! Canst
thou rule lines without blotting?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
Canst thou make ink and grind
colours and prepare gold size?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," said Gabriel, surprised
at the monk's eager manner,
"I have worked at all these
things."</p>

<p>"Good!" replied Brother Stephen.
"Here is a piece of parchment
thou canst cut and prepare,
and then rule it, thus" (and here
he showed him how he wished it
done), "with scarlet ink. But do
not take yonder brass ruler! Here
is one of ivory thou canst use
instead."</p>

<p>And then as Gabriel went to
work, Brother Stephen, taking a
goose-quill pen and some black
ink, began skilfully and carefully
to make drawings of the violets
as they lay on the ruler, not forgetting<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
the white butterfly which
still hovered about. The harder
he worked the happier he grew;
hour after hour passed, till at last
the dinner time came, and Gabriel,
who was growing very hungry,
could hear the footsteps of the
brothers, as they marched into
the large dining-room where they
all ate together.</p>

<p>Brother Stephen, however, was
so absorbed that he did not notice
anything; till, by and by, the door
opened, and in came two monks,
one carrying some soup and bread
and a flagon of wine. As they
entered, Brother Stephen turned
quickly, and was about to rise,
when all at once he felt the tug
of the chain still fastened about
the leg of the table; at this his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
face grew scarlet with shame, and
he sank back in his chair.</p>

<p>Gabriel started with surprise,
for he had not before seen the
chain, partly hidden as it was by
the folds of the brother's robe.
As he looked, one of the two
monks went to the table, and, with
a key which he carried, unlocked
the chain so Brother Stephen
might have a half-hour's liberty
while he ate. The monks, however,
stayed with him to keep an
eye on his movements; and meantime
they told Gabriel to go out
to the Abbey kitchen and find
something for his own dinner.</p>

<p>As Gabriel went out along the
corridor to the kitchen, his heart
swelled with pity! Why was
Brother Stephen chained? He<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
tried to think, and remembered
that once before he had seen one
of the brothers chained to a table
in the writing-room because he was
not diligent enough with his work,&mdash;but
Brother Stephen! Was he
not working so hard? And how
beautiful, too, were his drawings!
The more Gabriel thought of it
the more indignant he grew. Indeed,
he did not half-enjoy the
bread and savoury soup made of
black beans, that the cook dished
out for him; he took his wooden
bowl, and sitting on a bench, ate
absently, thinking all the while of
Brother Stephen.</p>

<p>When he had finished he went
back to the chapter-house and
found the other monks gone and
Brother Stephen again chained.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
Gabriel felt much embarrassed to
have been obliged to see it; and
when Brother Stephen, pointing
to the chain, said bitterly, "Thou
seest they were afraid I would run
away from my work," the lad was
so much at a loss to know what
to say, that he very wisely said
nothing.</p>

<p>Now Brother Stephen, though
he had begun the book as the
Abbot wished, yet he had by no
means the meek and penitent spirit
which also the Abbot desired of
him, and which it was proper for
a monk to have.</p>

<p>And so if the truth must be
told, each time the other monks
came in to chain him, he felt more
than anything else like seizing
both of them, and thrusting them<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
bodily out of the door, or at least
trying to do so. But then he could
not forget the Abbot's threat if he
showed disobedience; and he had
been brought up to dread the ban
of the Church more than anything
else that could possibly happen
to him, because he believed that
this would make him unhappy, not
only in this life, but in the life to
come. And so he smothered his
feelings and tried to bear the humiliation
as patiently as he could.</p>

<p>Gabriel could not help but see,
however, that it took him some
time to regain the interest he had
felt in his work, and it was not until
the afternoon was half-gone that
he seemed to forget his troubles
enough really to have heart in the
pages he was making.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>When dusk fell, Gabriel picked
up and arranged his things in
order, and bidding Brother Stephen
good night, trudged off
home.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>

<h3>GABRIEL INTERVIEWS THE ABBOT</h3>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 101px;">
<img src="images/drop_t.png" width="101" height="150" alt="T" title="" />
</div><div class='unindent'><br /><br />HE next day of Gabriel's
service passed off much
the same as the first, and
so it went for almost a
week; but the boy saw day by
day that Brother Stephen's chain
became more and more unbearable
to him, and that he had long
fits of brooding, when he looked
so miserable and unhappy that
Gabriel's heart fairly ached for
him.</div>

<p>At last the lad, who was a sympathetic
little fellow, felt that he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
could stand it no longer, but must
try and help him in some way.</p>

<p>"If I could only speak to the
Abbot himself," thought Gabriel,
"surely he would see that Brother
Stephen is set free!"</p>

<p>The Abbot, however, was a
very stately and dignified person;
and Gabriel did not quite see how
a little peasant boy like himself
could find an opportunity to speak
to him, or how he would dare to
say anything even if he had a
chance.</p>

<p>Now it happened the very
morning that Gabriel was thinking
about all this, he was out in
the Abbey kitchen beating up the
white of a nice fresh egg which
he had brought with him from
home that day. He had the egg<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
in an earthen bowl, and was working
away with a curious wooden
beater, for few people had forks
in those days. And as he beat
up the white froth, the Abbey
cooks also were very busy making
pasties, and roasting huge pieces
of meat before the great open fireplace,
and baking loaves of sweet
Normandy bread for the monks'
dinner.</p>

<p>But Gabriel was not helping
them; no, he was beating the egg
for Brother Stephen to use in putting
on the gold in the border he
was painting. For the brothers
did not have the imitation gold
powders of which we see so much
to-day; but instead, they used real
gold, which they ground up very
fine in earthen mortars, and took<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
much trouble to properly prepare.
And when they wanted to lay it
on, they commonly used the white
of a fresh egg to fasten it to the
parchment.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 313px;">
<img src="images/i012.jpg" width="313" height="400" alt="&quot;He saw the Abbot walking up and down&quot;" title="" />
<span class="caption">&quot;<i>He saw the Abbot walking up and down</i>&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>So Gabriel was working as fast
as he could, for Brother Stephen
was waiting; when all at once he
happened to look out the kitchen
door, which opened on a courtyard
where there was a pretty garden,
and he saw the Abbot walking up
and down the gravel paths, and
now and then stopping to see how
the tulips and daffodils were coming
on.</p>

<p>As Gabriel looked, the Abbot
seated himself on a stone bench;
and then the little boy, forgetting
his awe of him, and thinking only
of Brother Stephen and his chain<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
ran out as fast as he could, still
holding his bowl in one hand and
the wooden beater in the other.</p>

<p>As he came up to where the
Abbot was sitting, he courtesied
in such haste that he spilled out
half his egg as he eagerly burst
out:</p>

<p>"O reverend Father! will you
not command Brother Stephen to
be set free from his chain?"</p>

<p>The Abbot at first had smiled
at the droll figure made by the
little boy, whom he supposed to
be one of the kitchen scullions,
but at this speech he stiffened up
and looked very stern as Gabriel
went on breathlessly:</p>

<p>"He is making such a beautiful
book, and he works so hard; but
the chain is so dreadful to him,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
and I was sure that if you knew
they had put it on him, you would
not allow it!"</p>

<p>Here the Abbot began to feel
a trifle uncomfortable, for he saw
that Gabriel did not know that he
himself had ordered Brother Stephen
to wear the chain. But he
mentioned nothing of this as he
spoke to Gabriel.</p>

<p>"Boy," he said, severely, "what
affair of thine is this matter about
Brother Stephen? Doubtless if
he is chained, it is a punishment
he hath merited. 'Tis scarcely
becoming in a lad like thee to
question these things." And then,
as he looked sharply at Gabriel,
he added, "Did Brother Stephen
send thee hither? Who art
thou?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>At this Gabriel hung his head,
and, "Nay, sir," he answered,
simply, "he does not know, and
perhaps he will be angry with me!
I am his colour-grinder, and I was
in the kitchen getting the egg for
his gold,"&mdash;here suddenly Gabriel
remembered his bowl, and looking
down in dismay, "Oh, sir," he
exclaimed, "I have spilled the egg,
and it was fresh-laid this morning
by my white hen!" Here the
boy looked so honestly distressed
that the Abbot could not but believe
that he spoke the truth, and
so he smiled a little as he said,
not unkindly:</p>

<p>"Well, never mind about thy
hen,&mdash;go on; thou wast in the
kitchen, and then what?"</p>

<p>"I saw you in the garden,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
answered Gabriel, "and&mdash;and&mdash;I
thought that if you knew about
the chain, you would not like it;"
(here the Abbot began to look
very stern again); "and," Gabriel
added, "I could not bear to
see Brother Stephen so unhappy.
I know he is unhappy, for whenever
he notices the chain, he
frowns and his hand trembles so
he can hardly paint!"</p>

<p>"Ah," said the Abbot to himself,
"if his hand trembles, that is
another matter." For the Abbot
knew perfectly well that in order
to do successfully anything so delicate
as a piece of illumination,
one must have a steady hand and
untroubled nerves; and he began
to think that perhaps he had gone a
little too far in punishing Brother<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
Stephen. So he thought a minute,
and then to Gabriel, who was
still standing before him, not quite
knowing what to do, he merely
said:</p>

<p>"Go back to thy work, lad, and
mind thy colours; and," he added
with haughty dignity, "I will do
as I think best about Brother Stephen's
chain."</p>

<p>So Gabriel went back to the
kitchen feeling very uncomfortable,
for he was afraid he had displeased
the Abbot, and so, perhaps,
done more harm than good
to Brother Stephen. While he
was quite sure he had displeased
Brother Stephen, for he had kept
him waiting a long while, and
worse still, had spilled the best
egg there was in the kitchen!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
However, the lad begged one of
the cooks to let him have another
egg, and, whisking it up as quickly
as he could, made haste to carry it
to the chapter-house.</p>

<p>As he pushed open the door,
Brother Stephen said, sharply,
"How now! I thought they had
chained thee to one of the tables
of the kitchen!"</p>

<p>"I am so sorry," said Gabriel,
his face very red,&mdash;"but&mdash;I&mdash;I
spilled the first egg and had to
make ready another."</p>

<p>He hoped Brother Stephen
would not ask him how he happened
to spill it; for by this time
he began to realize that the high-spirited
monk probably had reasons
of his own for submitting to
the punishment of the chain, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
that very likely he would be displeased
if he knew that his little
colour-grinder had asked the
Abbot to free him. So Gabriel
felt much relieved when, without
further questions, Brother Stephen
went on with his work, in which
for the moment he was greatly
absorbed.</p>

<p>And thus the day went quietly
on, till early in the afternoon;
when, to the great surprise of
both of them, the door slowly
opened, and in walked the Abbot
himself.</p>

<p>The Abbot was haughty, as
usual, and, as Brother Stephen
saw him come in, he raised his
head with an involuntary look of
pride and resentment; but neither
spoke as the Abbot stepped over<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
to the table, and examined the
page on which the monk was
working.</p>

<p>This particular page happened
to be ornamented with a wide
border of purple flag-flowers,
copied from some Gabriel had
gathered the day before in a
swampy corner of one of the wayside
meadows. Their fresh green
leaves and rich purple petals shone
with royal effect against the background
of gold; while hovering
over them, and clinging to their
stems, were painted honey-bees,
with gauzy wings, and soft, furry-looking
bodies of black and gold.</p>

<p>As the Abbot saw how beautiful
it all was, and how different
from any other of the Abbey illuminations,
he smiled to himself<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
with pleasure. For the Abbot,
though he never said a great deal,
yet very well knew a good piece
of artistic work when he saw it.
Instead of merely smiling to himself,
however, it would have made
Brother Stephen much happier if
he had taken the trouble to say
aloud some of the nice things he
was thinking about the work.</p>

<p>For Brother Stephen felt very
bitter as he thought over all he
had been made to bear; and even
as the Abbot looked, he saw, sure
enough, that his hand trembled
as Gabriel had said; for the poor
monk had hard work to control
his feelings.</p>

<p>Now the Abbot really did not
mean to be unkind. It was only
that he did not quite know how<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
to unbend; and perhaps feeling
this, he soon went out.</p>

<p>Gabriel, who had been very
much afraid he might say something
to him about their conversation
of the morning, felt greatly
relieved when the door closed behind
him; and the rest of the
afternoon he and Brother Stephen
worked on in silence.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<h3>THE HOUR BOOK</h3>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 77px;">
<img src="images/drop_b.png" width="77" height="125" alt="B" title="" />
</div><div class='unindent'><br /><br />UT the next morning
when Gabriel reached the
Abbey, to his great joy
he found the chain gone
(for the Abbot had so ordered
after his visit to the chapter-house),
and Brother Stephen already hard
at work, and happy as a bird.
For like many other artist souls,
when things went wrong, Brother
Stephen suffered dreadful unhappiness;
while, on the other hand,
when pleased, he was full of
boundless delight; and so, being<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
relieved from the chain, he was in
one of his most joyous moods.</div>

<p>He smiled brightly as Gabriel
entered; and the April sunlight
streaming in through the high
narrow windows sparkled so radiantly,
and so filled them with
the life and energy and gladness
of the spring-time, that each of
them felt as though he could do
no end of work, and that King
Louis's book should be one of
the most beautiful things in all
the world!</p>

<p>And that morning was but the
beginning of a long series of
happy days that Brother Stephen
and Gabriel were to spend together.
At first the monk knew
nothing of how it happened that
he was freed from the humiliation<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
of the chain; but one day he
heard about Gabriel's talk with
the Abbot from one of the brotherhood
who had chanced to be in
the garden that morning, and
had overheard them.</p>

<p>At first Brother Stephen was
rather displeased; for he did not
like it that the little boy had
begged of the Abbot something
which he himself was too proud
to ask. But when he thought it
over, and reflected that it was out
of sheer kindness that Gabriel
had made the request, his heart
strangely warmed toward the lad.
Indeed, through all his life in the
Abbey, no one had ever really
cared whether he was happy or
unhappy; and so poor Brother
Stephen had had no idea how<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
very pleasant it would be to have
even a little peasant boy take an
interest in him. And as day
after day went by, he began to
love Gabriel, as he had never
before loved any one.</p>

<p>Yes, those were very happy
days for both of them, and very
busy ones, too. Every morning
Gabriel would come to the Abbey
with his hands filled with the
prettiest wild flowers he could
find on the way; and from these
Brother Stephen would select the
ones that pleased him best to
paint. Sometimes it would be
the sweet wild hyacinths of pale
blue, sometimes the yellow marsh-marigolds,
and again the little
deep pink field-roses, or some
other of the innumerable lovely<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
blossoms that every season
brought. And with them all, as
he had said, he put in the small
flying creatures; butterflies and
bees, scarlet ladybugs and pale
green beetles, whose wings looked
like scraps of rainbows; and
sometimes, in his zeal, he even
painted the little snails with their
curled-up shells, and the fuzzy
caterpillars that happened to come
in on Gabriel's bouquets, and you
really would never believe how
very handsome even these looked
in the gold borders, when Brother
Stephen got through with them.</p>

<p>And so, day by day, the book
grew in perfect beauty. And as
Brother Stephen worked, there
was much for Gabriel to do also.
For in those days artists could<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
not buy their ink and paints all
ready for use as they do to-day,
but were obliged to prepare by
hand almost all their materials;
and a little assistant such as Gabriel
had to keep his hands busy,
and his eyes open, too.</p>

<p>For instance, the matter of the
ink alone, Gabriel had to have on
his mind for weeks; for one could
not then buy it ready made, in a
bottle, as we do now without the
least trouble, but the monks or
their colour-grinders had to make
it themselves.</p>

<p>And this is the way Gabriel
had been taught to do it: morning
after morning of those early
spring days, as he trudged along
on his way to the Abbey, he kept
sharp watch on the young hawthorn-trees<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
by the roadside; and
when their first buds showed, and
while they were still tiny, he gathered
armfuls of the boughs, and
carried them to the Abbey, where
he spread them out in a sunny
corner of the courtyard to stay
until quite dry. Then he had to
put them in a stone mortar and
pound off all the bark; and this
he put to steep in great earthen
jars of water, until the water
might draw all the sap from out
the bark. All this took several
weeks to do.</p>

<p>And then Gabriel spent a
number of busy days in the great
kitchen. There he had a large
saucepan, and in it he placed, a
little at a time, the water in which
the bark was steeping; and then<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
raking out some coals from the
blazing fire of logs, he set his
saucepan over them, and watched
the barky water until it had boiled
down very thick, much as one
boils down syrup for preserves.</p>

<p>Then he dipped out the thick
liquid into little bags of parchment,
which he had spent days
stitching up very tightly, so that
nothing could leak out. After
the little bags were filled, he hung
them out-of-doors in the bright
sunlight; and as the days grew
warmer and warmer, the sun soon
dried their contents, so that if
one of the little bags were opened
it would be found filled with a
dark powder.</p>

<p>And then, last of all, when
Brother Stephen wished some<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
fresh ink for his writing, or for
the delicate lines about his initial
letters or borders, Gabriel would
take a little of the dry powder
from one of the bags, and, putting
it in a small saucepan over the
fire, would melt it with a little
wine. And so at last it would
be ready for use; a fine, beautiful
black ink that hundreds of
years have found hard work to
fade.</p>


<p>Then there was the gold to
grind and prepare; that was the
hardest of all, and fairly made
his arms ache. Many of the
paints, too, had to be worked over
very carefully; and the blue especially,
and other brilliant colours
made from vegetable dyes, must
be kept in a very curious way.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
Brother Stephen would prepare
the dyes, as he preferred to do
this himself; and then Gabriel
would take little pieces of linen
cloth and dip a few in each of
the colours until the linen would
be soaked; and afterward, when
they had dried in the sun, he
would arrange these bits in a little
booklet of cotton paper, which
every night Brother Stephen, as
was the custom with many of the
monks, put under his pillow so
that it might keep very dry and
warm; for this preserved the
colours in all their brightness.
And then when he wanted to
use some of them, he would tell
Gabriel to cut off a bit of the
linen of whatever colour he
wished, and soak it in water, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
in this way he would get a fine
liquid paint.</p>
<div class="figright" style="width: 319px;">
<img src="images/i014.jpg" width="319" height="400" alt="&quot;Dreaming of all the beautiful things he meant to paint&quot;" title="" />
<span class="caption">&quot;<i>Dreaming of all the beautiful things he meant to paint</i>&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>For holding this paint, as
dishes were none too plenty in
those days, mussel shells were
generally used; and one of Gabriel's
tasks was to gather numbers
of these from the banks of
the little river that ran through
one of the Abbey meadows. That
was very pleasant work, though,
and sometimes, late in the afternoons
of those lovely summer
days, Brother Stephen and Gabriel
would walk out together to
the edge of this little river; the
monk to sit on the grassy bank
dreaming of all the beautiful
things he meant to paint, while
Gabriel hunted for the pretty
purple shells.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>And oftentimes the lad would
bring along a fishing-pole and
try his luck at catching an eel; for
even this, too, had to do with the
making of the book. For Brother
Stephen in putting on the gold
of his borders, while he generally
used white of egg, yet for certain
parts preferred a glue made from
the skin of an eel; and this Gabriel
could make very finely.</p>

<p>So you see there were a great
many things for a little colour-grinder
to do; yet Gabriel was
very industrious, and it often happened
that he would finish his
tasks for the day, and still have
several hours to himself. And
this was the best of all; for at
such times Brother Stephen, who
was getting along finely, would<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
take great pleasure in teaching
him to illuminate. He would let
the boy take a piece of parchment,
and then giving him beautiful
letters and bits of borders, would
show him how to copy them.
Indeed, he took so much pains in
his teaching, that very soon Gabriel,
who loved the work, and
who had a real talent for it, began
to be quite skilful, and to
make very good designs of his
own.</p>

<p>Whenever he did anything
especially nice, Brother Stephen
would seem almost as much
pleased as if Gabriel were his
own boy; and hugging him affectionately,
he would exclaim:</p>

<p>"Ah, little one, thou hast indeed
the artist soul! And, please<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
God, I will train thy hand so that
when thou art a man it shall
never know the hard toil of the
peasant. Thy pen and brush
shall earn a livelihood for thee!"
And then he would take more
pains than ever to teach Gabriel
all the best knowledge of his art.</p>

<p>Nor did Brother Stephen content
himself with teaching the boy
only to paint; but in his love for
him, he desired to do still more.
He had no wealth some day to
bestow upon him, but he had
something that was a very great
deal better; for Brother Stephen,
like many of the monks of the
time, had a good education; and
this he determined to share with
Gabriel.</p>

<p>He arranged to have him stay<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
at the Abbey for his supper as
often as he could be spared from
home; and hour after hour of the
long summer evenings he spent
teaching the lad to read and write,
which was really quite a distinction;
for it was an accomplishment
that none of the peasants,
and very few of the lords and
ladies of that time possessed. Gabriel
was quick and eager to learn,
and Brother Stephen gradually
added other things to his list of
studies, and both of them took
the greatest pleasure in the hours
thus passed together.</p>

<p>Sometimes they would go out
into the garden, and, sitting on
one of the quaint stone benches,
Brother Stephen would point out
to Gabriel the different stars, or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
tell him about the fragrant growing
plants around them; or, perhaps,
repeat to him some dreamy
legend of old, old Normandy.</p>

<p>And then, by and by, Gabriel
would go home through the perfumed
dark, feeling vaguely happy;
for all the while, through those
pleasant evenings with Brother
Stephen, his mind and heart were
opening brightly as the yellow
primroses, that blossomed by moonlight
over all the Abbey meadows.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V.</h2>

<h3>THE COUNT'S TAX</h3>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 83px;">
<img src="images/drop_a.png" width="83" height="125" alt="A" title="" />
</div><div class='unindent'><br /><br />ND in this happy manner
the spring and summer
wore away and the autumn
came. Brother
Stephen felt very cheerful, for the
beautiful book grew more beautiful
week by week; and he was
very proud and happy, because he
knew it was the loveliest thing
he had ever made.</div>

<p>Indeed, he himself was so cheerful,
that as the autumn days, one
after another, melted away, it was
some little time before he noticed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
that Gabriel was losing his merriness,
and that he had begun to
look sad and distressed. And
finally, one morning, he came looking
so very unhappy, that Brother
Stephen asked, with much concern:</p>

<p>"Why, lad, whither have all
thy gay spirits taken flight? Art
thou ill?"</p>

<p>"Nay, sir," answered Gabriel,
sadly; "but oh, Brother Stephen,
we are in so much trouble at
home!"</p>

<p>At this the monk at once began
to question him, and learned that
Gabriel's family were indeed in
great misfortune.</p>

<p>And this is how it came about:
in those days the peasant folk
had a very hard time indeed.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
All of the land through the country
was owned by the great nobles;
and the poor peasants, who lived
on the little farms into which the
land was divided, had few rights.
They could not even move to
another place if they so wished,
but were obliged to spend all
their lives under the control of
whatever nobleman happened to
own the estate on which they
were born.</p>

<p>They lived in little thatched
cottages, and cultivated their bits
of land; and as rent for this, each
peasant was obliged to help support
the great lord who owned
everything, and who always lived
in a strong castle, with armed
men under his command.</p>

<p>The peasants had to raise<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
wheat and vegetables and sheep
and cows, so that the people of
the castles might eat nice, white
bread, and nut cookies and roast
meat; though the poor peasants
themselves had to be content, day
after day, with little more than
hard, black bread, and perhaps a
single bowl of cabbage or potato
soup, from which the whole family
would dip with their wooden
spoons.</p>

<p>Then, too, the peasants oftentimes
had to pay taxes when their
noble lord wished to raise money,
and even to follow him to war if
he so commanded, though this
did not often happen.</p>

<p>And now we come to the reason
for Gabriel's troubles. It
seems that the Count Pierre de<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
Bouchage, to whose estate Gabriel's
family belonged, had got
into a quarrel with a certain baron
who lived near the town of Evreux,
and Count Pierre was determined
to take his followers
and attack the baron's castle; for
these private wars were very common
in those days.</p>

<p>But Count Pierre needed money
to carry on his little war, and so
had laid a very heavy tax on the
peasants of his estate; and Gabriel's
father had been unable to
raise the sum of money demanded.
For besides Gabriel, there were
several little brothers and sisters
in the family, Jean and Margot
and little Guillaume, who must be
clothed and fed; and though the
father was honest and hard-working,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
yet the land of their little
farm was poor, and it was all the
family could do to find themselves
enough on which to live.</p>

<p>When peasant Viaud had
begged Count Pierre to release
him from the tax, the count, who
was hard and unsympathetic, had
become angry, and given orders
that the greater part of their little
farm should be taken from them,
and he had seized also their little
flock of sheep. This was a grievous
loss, for out of the wool that
grew on the sheeps' backs, Gabriel's
mother every winter made
the warm, homespun clothes for
all the family.</p>

<p>Indeed, Count Pierre had no
real right to do all this; but in
those times, when a noble lord<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
chose to be cruel and unjust, the
poor peasants had no way to help
matters.</p>

<p>And this was not all of Gabriel's
woes; for only a few days
after he had told these things to
Brother Stephen, when he went
home at night, he found his
mother crying bitterly, and learned
that Count Pierre, who was having
some trouble in raising his
money, and so had become more
merciless than ever, had that day
imprisoned his father at the castle,
and refused to release him unless
some of the tax were paid.</p>

<p>This was the hardest blow of
all; and though the other children
were too young to understand all
that had befallen them, poor Gabriel
and his mother were so distressed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
that neither slept that
night; and the next morning when
the little boy arose, tired out instead
of rested by the long night,
he had scarcely the heart to go
away to the Abbey, and leave
things so miserable at home.
But his mother thought it best for
him to keep on with his work
with Brother Stephen, because of
the little sum he earned; and then,
too, he felt that he must do his
part to help until King Louis's
book was finished. After that,
he did not know what he could
do! He did not know how he
could best try to take his father's
place and help the family; for,
after all, he knew he was only a
little boy, and so things seemed
very hopeless!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p>Indeed the grief and poverty
that had come upon them at home
made Gabriel so sad that Brother
Stephen was quite heart-broken,
too, for he deeply loved the lad.
As he worked, he kept trying all
the while to think of some way
to help them; but as the monk
had passed all his life within
the walls of the Abbey, he knew
but little of the ways of the outside
world; and he had no money
of his own, or he would gladly
have paid the tax himself.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<h3>GABRIEL'S PRAYER</h3>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 80px;">
<img src="images/drop_m.png" width="80" height="125" alt="M" title="" />
</div><div class='unindent'><br /><br />EANTIME, though they
worked quietly, they were
both very industrious;
and at last one day, late
in October, when the first snow
was beginning to fall, Brother
Stephen finished the last page of
the beautiful book. He gave a
sigh as he laid down his paintbrush;
not because he was tired,
but because in his heart he was
really sorry to finish his work, for
he knew that then it would soon
be taken away, and he hated to
part with it.</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p>As he and Gabriel laid all the
pages together in the order in
which they were to go, brother
Stephen's heart swelled with pride,
and Gabriel thought he had never
seen anything half so lovely!</p>

<p>The text was written in beautiful
letters of the lustrous black ink
which Gabriel had made; and at
the beginnings of new chapters,
wonderful initial letters glittered
in gold and colours till they
looked like little mosaics of precious
stones.</p>

<p>Here and there through the
text were scattered exquisite miniature
pictures of saints and
angels; while as for the borders
that enclosed every page, they
wreathed around the written
words such lovely garlands of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
painted blossoms, that to Gabriel
the whole book seemed a marvellous
bouquet of all the sweet
flowers he had daily gathered
from the Norman fields, and that
Brother Stephen, by the magic of
his art, had made immortal.</p>

<p>Indeed the little boy fairly
blinked as he looked at the sparkling
beauty of those pages where
the blossoms were to live on,
through the centuries, bright and
beautiful and unharmed by wind
or rain or the driving snow, that
even then was covering up all the
bare frost-smitten meadows without.</p>

<p>And so Gabriel turned over
page after page shining with gold
and purple and rose-colour, till
he came to the very last of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
text; and then he saw that there
was yet one page more, and on
turning over this he read these
words:</p>

<p>"I, Brother Stephen, of the
Abbey of St. Martin-de-Bouchage,
made this book; and for
every initial letter and picture and
border of flowers that I have
herein wrought, I pray the Lord
God to have compassion upon
some one of my grievous sins!"</p>

<p>This was written in beautifully,
and all around it was painted a
graceful border like braided ribbons
of blue.</p>

<p>Now in Brother Stephen's time,
when any one finished an especially
beautiful illumination of
any part of the Bible, it was
quite customary for the artist to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
add, at the end, a little prayer.
Indeed, no one can make a really
beautiful thing without loving the
work; and those old-time artist-monks
took such delight in the
flowery pages they painted, that
they felt sure the dear Lord himself
could not help but be pleased
to have his words made so beautiful,
and that he would so grant
the little prayer at the end of the
book, because of the loving labour
that had gone before.</p>

<p>As Gabriel again read over
Brother Stephen's last page, it
set him to thinking; and a little
later, as he walked home in the
frosty dusk, he thought of it again.</p>

<p>It was true, he said to himself,
that all the beautiful written and
painted work on King Louis's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
book had been done by Brother
Stephen's hands,&mdash;and yet,&mdash;and
yet,&mdash;had not he, too, helped?
Had he not gathered the thorny
hawthorn, and pricked his fingers,
and spent days and days
making the ink? Had he not,
week after week, ground the colours
and the gold till his arms
ached, and his hands were blistered?
Had he not made the
glue, and prepared the parchment,
and ruled the lines (and one had
to be <i>so</i> careful not to blot them!),
and brought all the flowers for
the borders?</p>

<p>Surely, he thought, though he
had not painted any of its lovely
pages, yet he had done his little
part to help make the book, and
so, perhaps&mdash;perhaps&mdash;might<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
not the Lord God feel kindly
toward him, too, and be willing to
grant a little prayer to him also?</p>

<p>Now of course Gabriel could
have prayed any time and anywhere,
and simply asked for what
he wanted. But he had a strong
feeling that God would be much
more apt to notice it, if the
prayer were beautifully written
out, like Brother Stephen's, and
placed in the book itself, on the
making of which he had worked
so long and so hard.</p>

<p>Gabriel was very pleased with
his idea, and by the time he
reached home, he had planned
out just what he wanted to say.
He ate his supper of hard black
bread very happily, and when,
soon after, he crept into bed and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
pulled up his cover of ragged
sheepskin, he went to sleep with
his head so full of the work of
the past few months, that he
dreamed that the whole world was
full of painted books and angels
with rose-coloured wings; that all
the meadows of Normandy were
covered with gold, and the flowers
fastened on with white of egg
and eel-skins; and then, just as
he was getting out his ruler to
rule lines over the blue sky, he
rubbed his eyes and woke up;
and, finding it was morning, he
jumped out of bed, and hastened
to make himself ready for his
day's work.</p>

<p>When he reached the Abbey,
Brother Stephen was busy binding
together the finished leaves<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
of the book; for the monks had
to do not only the painting, but
also the putting together of their
books themselves.</p>

<p>After Gabriel had waited on
Brother Stephen for awhile, the
latter told him he could have
some time to himself, and so he
hurried to get out the little jars
of scarlet and blue and black ink,
and the bits of parchment that
Brother Stephen had given him.
He looked over the parchment
carefully, and at last found one
piece from which he could cut a
page that was almost as large as
the pages of the book. It was an
old piece, and had some writing
on one side, but he knew how to
scrape it off clean; and then taking
some of the scarlet ink, he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
ruled some lines in the centre of
the page, and between these, in
the nicest black letters he knew
how to make, he wrote his little
prayer. And this is the way it
read:</p>

<p>"I, Gabriel Viaud, am Brother
Stephen's colour-grinder; and I
have made the ink for this book,
and the glue, and caught the eels,
and ground the gold and colours,
and ruled the lines and gathered
the flowers for the borders, and
so I pray the Lord God will be
kind and let my father out of
prison in Count Pierre's castle,
and tell Count Pierre to give
us back our meadow and sheep,
for we cannot pay the tax, and
mother says we will starve."</p>

<p>Now in the little prayers that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
the monks added at the end of a
book, it was the custom to ask
only that their sins might be forgiven.
But Gabriel, though he
knew he had plenty of sins,&mdash;for
so the parish priest of St. Martin's
village told all the peasant folk
every Sunday,&mdash;yet somehow
could not feel nearly so anxious
to have them forgiven, as he was
to have his father freed from
prison in the castle, and their
little farm and flock restored to
them; and so he had decided to
word his prayer the way he did.</p>

<p>It took him some time to write
it out, for he took great pains to
shape every letter as perfectly as
possible. Nor did he forget that
Brother Stephen had taught him
always to make the word God<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
more beautiful than the others;
so he wrote that in scarlet ink,
and edged it with scallops and
loops and little dots of blue; and
then all around the whole prayer
he made graceful flourishes of
the coloured inks. He very
much wished for a bit of gold
with which to enrich his work,
but gold was too precious for
little boys to practise with, and
so Brother Stephen had not given
him any for his own. Nevertheless,
when the page was finished,
the artistic effect was very pleasing,
and it really was a remarkably
clever piece of work for a
little boy to have made.</p>

<p>He did not tell Brother Stephen
what he was doing, for he
was afraid that perhaps he might<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
not quite approve of his plan.
Not that Gabriel wished for a
moment to do anything that
Brother Stephen would not like
him to do, but only that he thought
their affairs at home so desperate
that he could not afford to risk
losing this means of help;&mdash;and
then, too, he felt that the prayer
was his own little secret, and he
did not want to tell any one about
it anyway.</p>

<p>And so he was greatly relieved
that Brother Stephen, who was
very much absorbed in his own
work, did not ask him any questions.
The monk was always
very kind about helping him in
every way possible, but never insisted
on Gabriel's showing him
everything, wisely thinking that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
many times it was best to let the
boy work out his own ideas. So
Gabriel said nothing about his
page, but put it carefully away,
until he could find some opportunity
to place it in the book
itself.</p>

<p>Meantime Brother Stephen
worked industriously, and in a
few days more he had quite finished
the book. He had strongly
bound all his painted pages together,
and put on a cover of
violet velvet, which the nuns of a
near-by convent had exquisitely
embroidered in pearls and gold.
And, last of all, the cover was
fastened with clasps of wrought
gold, set with amethysts. Altogether
it was a royal gift, and one
worthy of any queen. Even the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
Abbot, cold and stately though
he usually was, exclaimed with
pleasure when he saw it, and
warmly praised Brother Stephen
upon the loveliness of his work.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII.</h2>

<h3>THE BOOK GOES TO LADY ANNE</h3>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 83px;">
<img src="images/drop_a.png" width="83" height="125" alt="A" title="" />
</div><div class='unindent'><br /><br />ND it was well that the
beautiful book was finished,
for the very next
afternoon a nobleman,
with several attendants, arrived
at the Abbey to see if the work
were done. The nobleman was
Count Henri of Lisieux, who had
been sent by King Louis to bear
to Lady Anne a precious casket
of jewels as part of his bridal
gifts to her; and the count had
also received orders from the
king to go to St. Martin's Abbey<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
on his way, and if the book of
hours were finished, to take it
along to the Lady Anne.</div>

<p>Count Henri was greatly
pleased when they showed the
work to him, and he said that he
knew both King Louis and his
bride could not help but be delighted
with it. And then, after
it had been duly looked at and
admired, the book was wrapped up
in a piece of soft, rich silk and laid
on a shelf in the chapter-house to
wait until the next morning, when
Count Henri would take it away.
For he had come far, and the
Abbot had invited him to stay
overnight in the Abbey before
going on with his journey.</p>

<p>While all this was taking place,
and the book was being examined,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
Gabriel had been quietly at work
in one corner of the chapter-house,
grinding some gold; and when he
heard that Count Henri was going
away the next morning, he
knew that if he expected to put
his own little page in the book,
he must do so some time before
he went home that evening; and
he did not quite see how he could
manage it.</p>

<p>Late in the afternoon, however,
a little before dusk, all the others
left the chapter-house, Brother
Stephen to go to his own cell,
while the Abbot took Count
Henri out to show him over the
Abbey. And just as soon as
they were gone, Gabriel hastily
put down the stone mortar in
which he was grinding the gold,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
and, going over to the work-table,
opened the drawer in which he
kept his own things, and took out
the page on which he had written
his little prayer.</p>

<p>He then went to the shelf and
took down the book. He felt
guilty as he unfolded the silk
wrappings, and his hands trembled
as he loosened the golden
clasps, and hurriedly slipped in
his piece of parchment. He put
it in at the very back of the book,
after Brother Stephen's last page.
Then carefully refastening the
clasps, and again folding it up in
its silken cover, he replaced the
book on the shelf.</p>

<p>Poor Gabriel did not know
whether he had done very wrong
or not in taking this liberty with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
the painted book. He only knew
that he could not bear to have it
go away without his little prayer
between its covers; and he thought
that now God would surely notice
it, as he had written it as nicely as
he knew how, and had placed it
next to Brother Stephen's.</p>

<p>By this time it was growing
dark, and so Gabriel left the
Abbey and took his way home.
When he reached their forlorn
little cottage, he found only a
scanty supper awaiting him, and
very early he went to bed; for
they had but little fire and were
too poor to afford even a single
candle to burn through the long
winter evening.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 305px;">
<img src="images/i018.jpg" width="305" height="400" alt="&quot;Taking down the book . . . he unwrapped and unclasped it&quot;" title="" />
<span class="caption">&quot;<i>Taking down the book . . . he unwrapped and unclasped it</i>&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>As Gabriel lay shivering in his
cold little bed, he wondered how<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
long it would be before God
would grant his prayer for help.
And then he wondered if God
would be displeased because he
had dared to put it in the beautiful
book without asking permission
from Brother Stephen or the
Abbot. And the more he thought
of the possibility of this, and of
all their other troubles, the more
miserable he felt, till at last he
sobbed himself to sleep.</p>

<p>The poor little boy did not
know that after he himself had
been sleeping for several hours,
Brother Stephen, who had not
slept, came out of his cell in the
Abbey, and, carrying in his hand
a small lamp, passed softly down
the corridor and into the chapter-house.
For Brother Stephen,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
like many another true artist who
has worked long and lovingly
upon some exquisite thing, found
it very hard to part with that
which he had made. He did not
expect ever again to see the beautiful
book after it left the Abbey,
and so he felt that he must take
a farewell look at it all by himself.</p>

<p>As he entered the chapter-house,
he set the lamp on the
table; and then taking down the
book and placing it also on
the table, he unwrapped and unclasped
it, and seating himself in
front of it, looked long and earnestly
at each page as he slowly
turned them over, one by one.</p>

<p>When at last he came to the
end, and found a loose leaf, he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
picked it up in dismay, wondering
if his binding could have been so
badly done that one of the pages
had already become unfastened.
But his look of dismay changed
to bewilderment as he examined
the page more closely, and saw
Gabriel's little prayer. He read
this over twice, very slowly; and
then, still holding the page in his
hand, he sat for a long time with
his head bowed; and once or
twice something that looked very
like a tear fell on the stone floor
at his feet.</p>

<p>After awhile the lamp began
to burn low; and Brother Stephen
rising, gave a tender look to the
loose page he had been holding,
and then carefully put it back in
the book, taking pains to place<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
it, as nearly as he could, exactly
as Gabriel had done. Then, with
a sigh, he shut the velvet covers,
once more fastened the golden
clasps, and, replacing the silken
wrappings, laid the book on the
shelf, and went back to his cell.</p>

<p>The next morning Count Henri
and his escort made ready for
their journey to Bretagne. Count
Henri himself placed the precious
book in the same velvet bag which
held the casket of jewels for the
Lady Anne, and this bag he hung
over his saddle-bow directly in
front of him, so that he could
keep close watch and see that
no harm befell King Louis's
gifts.</p>

<p>And then he and his soldiers
mounted their horses, and, taking<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
a courteous leave of the Abbot
and the brotherhood of St. Martin's,
they trotted off along the
frosty road.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>

<h3>LADY ANNE WRITES TO THE KING</h3>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 83px;">
<img src="images/drop_a.png" width="83" height="125" alt="A" title="" />
</div><div class='unindent'><br /><br />FTER several days' journey
they entered Bretagne,
and before long
drew near to the city of
Nantes and the castle of Lady
Anne. This castle was very
large, and had many towers and
gables and little turrets with sharp-pointed,
conical roofs. There
was a high wall and a moat all
around it, and as Count Henri
approached, he displayed a little
banner given him by King Louis,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
and made of blue silk embroidered
with three golden lilies.</div>

<p>At the sight of this, the keepers
of the drawbridge (who in
those days always had to be very
watchful not to admit enemies to
their lord's castle) instantly lowered
the bridge, and Count Henri
and his guard rode over and were
respectfully received within the
gate.</p>

<p>They dismounted in the courtyard,
and then, after resting awhile
in one of the rooms of the castle,
Count Henri was escorted into
the great hall of state, where
Lady Anne was ready to receive
him.</p>

<p>This hall was very large and
handsome, with a high, arched
ceiling, and walls hung with wonderful<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
old tapestries. Standing
about in groups were numbers of
picturesquely dressed pages, ladies-in-waiting,
richly clad, and Breton
gentlemen gorgeous in velvets and
lace ruffles, for a hundred of these
always attended Lady Anne wherever
she went. At one end of
the hall was a dais spread with
cloth of gold, and there, in a
carved chair, sat the Lady Anne
herself. She wore a beautiful
robe of brocaded crimson velvet,
and over her dark hair was a
curious, pointed head-dress of
white silk embroidered with pearls
and gold thread.</p>

<p>As Count Henri approached,
she greeted him very cordially;
and then, kneeling before her,
he said:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>

<p>"My Lady, I have the happiness
to deliver to your hands these
bridal gifts which our gracious
sovereign, King Louis, did me
the honour to entrust to my
care."</p>

<p>And then, as he handed to her
the casket of jewels and the silken
package containing the hour book,
she replied:</p>

<p>"Sir Count, I thank you for
your courtesy in bearing these
gifts to me, and I am well pleased
to receive them."</p>

<p>Then summoning a little page,
she told him to carry the presents
up to her own chamber, where she
might examine them at her leisure.</p>

<p>By and by, Count Henri withdrew,
after asking permission to
start the next morning on his return<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
to Paris; for he wished to
report to the king that he had
safely accomplished his errand.</p>

<p>And then Lady Anne, having
given orders that he and his followers
be hospitably entertained
during their stay in the castle,
mounted the great stone staircase,
and went to her own room, for
she very much wanted to look at
the gifts from King Louis.</p>

<p>These she found on a table
where the little page had placed
them. The casket was uncovered,
while the book was still
wrapped up in the piece of silk,
so that one could not tell just
what it was.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 316px;">
<img src="images/i020.jpg" width="316" height="400" alt="&quot;Began slowly to turn over the pages&quot;" title="" />
<span class="caption">&quot;<i>Began slowly to turn over the pages</i>&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>Lady Anne opened the casket
first, as it happened to be nearest
to her; and she drew in her breath,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
and her eyes sparkled with pleasure,
as she lifted out a magnificent
necklace, and other rich
jewels that gleamed and glittered
in the light like blue and crimson
fires. She tried on all the ornaments,
and then, after awhile,
when she had admired them to
her heart's content, she took up
the silk-covered package, and
curiously unwrapped it. When
she saw what it contained, however,
her face grew radiant with
delight, and&mdash;</p>

<p>"Ah!" she exclaimed to herself,
"King Louis's gifts are indeed
princely, and this one is the
most royal of all!"</p>

<p>For King Louis had been entirely
right in thinking nothing
would please the Lady Anne<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
quite so much as a piece of fine
illumination.</p>

<p>Still holding the book carefully
in her hands, she at once
seated herself in a deep, cushioned
chair, and began slowly to
turn over the pages, taking the
keenest pleasure, as she did so, in
every fresh beauty on which her
eyes fell. When she had gone
about half through the book, she
lifted it up to look more closely
at an especially beautiful initial
letter, and then, all at once, out
fluttered the loose leaf which Gabriel
had put in.</p>

<p>As it fell to the floor, a little
page near by hastened to pick it
up, and, bending on one knee, presented
it to Lady Anne. At first
she frowned a little, for she thought,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
as had Brother Stephen, that the
book must have been badly bound.
But when she took the leaf in
her hand, to her surprise, she saw
that it was different from the
others, and that it had not been
bound in with them; and then
she read over the writing very
carefully. When she had finished,
she sat for some time, just
as Brother Stephen had done,
holding the page in her hand,
while her face wore a very tender
expression.</p>

<p>Lady Anne was really deeply
touched by Gabriel's little prayer,
and she wished greatly that she
herself might find a way to help
him and his family out of their
trouble.</p>

<p>But the more she thought about<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
it, she realized that she had no
authority over a Norman nobleman,
and that no one in France,
except the king, was powerful
enough to compel Count Pierre
to release the peasant Viaud from
imprisonment.</p>

<p>So going over to a little writing-table,
she took out a thin
sheet of parchment, a quaint goose-quill
pen, and a small horn full
of ink, and wrote a letter which
she addressed to King Louis.
Then she took the loose leaf on
which Gabriel's prayer was written,
and, folding it in with her letter,
tied the little packet with a thread
of scarlet silk (for no one used
envelopes then), and sealed it with
some red wax. And on the wax
she pressed a carved ring which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
she wore, and which left a print
that looked like a tiny tuft of
ermine fur encircled by a bit of
knotted cord; for this was Lady
Anne's emblem, as it was called,
and King Louis, seeing it, would
know at once that the packet came
from her.</p>

<p>Then she went down into the
great hall of the castle, and sent
one of her Breton gentlemen to
bring Count Henri. When the
latter entered, she said to him:</p>

<p>"Sir Count, it would give me
great pleasure to keep you longer
as my guest, but if you must return
to Paris tomorrow, I will
ask you to be my bearer for a
little packet which I am anxious
to send to King Louis."</p>

<p>Then, as she handed it to him,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
she added with a smile, "I give it
to you now, for if you ride early
in the morning, I must leave my
Breton gentlemen to do the honours
of your stirrup-cup."</p>

<p>(This last was the cup of wine
which it was considered polite to
offer a departing guest as he
mounted his horse, and was a
little ceremony over which Lady
Anne liked to preside herself;
that is, when her guests went away
at agreeable hours.)</p>

<p>As Count Henri received the
packet from her, he made a very
deep bow, and replied that he
would be most happy to serve the
Lady Anne in any way he could,
and that he only awaited her command
to start at once on his
journey.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p>"Nay," said Lady Anne, with
another little smile, "'tis no affair
of state importance! Only a
matter of my own on which
I have set my heart. But I
will not hear to your setting
forth, until you have sat at my
table and rested overnight in the
castle."</p>

<p>To this Count Henri again
gallantly bowed his obedience;
and then, before long, Lady Anne
led all the company into the great
banquet-hall, where a number of
long tables were set out with
roasted game, and bread and wine
and the many different cakes and
sweetmeats of Bretagne.</p>

<p>The Lady Anne took her place
at the head of the longest table
of all, and she placed Count<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
Henri at her right hand. Near
them sat many of the ladies-in-waiting,
and Breton gentlemen of
the highest rank; while at the
farther end, beyond a great silver
saltcellar standing in the middle
of the table, were seated those of
less degree.</p>

<p>The dishes were of gold and
silver, and Lady Anne herself
was waited upon by two
noblemen of Bretagne, for she
lived very magnificently, as was
fitting for the bride of King
Louis.</p>

<p>When the supper was over,
they all went back into the great
castle hall, where bright fires of
logs were blazing in the huge
fireplaces; and as they sat in the
firelight, they listened to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
beautiful songs and music of two
troubadours who had that day
chanced to come to the castle, and
who sang so sweetly that it was
very late before the company
broke up for the night.</p>

<p>All through the evening, however,
in spite of the pleasant entertainment,
Lady Anne, who was
very sympathetic, could not help
but think many times of poor little
Gabriel, and how cold and hungry
and miserable he must be! She
had been much struck, too, with
the beautiful way in which he had
written out and ornamented his
little prayer, for she was a good
judge of such things; and, as she
thought about it, she determined
some day to see the lad herself.
Meantime she was very anxious<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
to help him as soon as possible.
Indeed, she felt much happier
when the next morning came, and
Count Henri set out for Paris;
for then she knew that her letter
and Gabriel's little written page
were on their way to King
Louis.</p>

<p>In due time, Count Henri arrived
safely at the king's palace,
and delivered the packet from
Lady Anne. And when King
Louis broke the wax seal, and
read the letter and Gabriel's little
prayer, he, too, was deeply touched.
Lady Anne's letter explained to
him about finding the loose page
in the beautiful book he had
sent her, and asked that he would
see to it that Count Pierre set the
boy's father free.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>

<p>This King Louis at once determined
to do, for he was a just
and kind-hearted monarch, and
during his reign did much to
lighten the taxes and oppression
of the peasant-folk; and, moreover,
in this trouble of Gabriel's
father, he now took an especial
interest, as it gave him great
pleasure to grant any wish of
the Lady Anne, whom he loved
deeply.</p>

<p>So that very day he sent for a
trusty messenger, and after explaining
things to him, directed
him to set out as soon as possible
for St. Martin's Abbey, and
there to seek out Brother Stephen
and inquire about the little peasant
boy, Gabriel Viaud. And
then, if he found everything to be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
true that Gabriel had said in his
prayer, he was to act according to
further orders which King Louis
gave him.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER IX.</h2>

<h3>THE KING'S MESSENGER</h3>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 82px;">
<img src="images/drop_n.png" width="82" height="125" alt="N" title="" />
</div><div class='unindent'><br /><br />OW while all these things
had been going on, poor
Gabriel had been growing
more wretchedly unhappy
day by day. His people
had become poorer and poorer,
and the long, cold winter was
upon them. They had almost
given up hope of the release of
peasant Viaud from prison, and
did not know where they could
get bread or fire to keep them
alive through the bitter cold.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
Sometimes Gabriel thought with
despair of how much he had
hoped from his little prayer! For
he was sure, by this time, that
God was angry with him for daring
to put it in the beautiful book.</div>

<p>And to add the last touch to
his distress, he had been obliged
to give up his work and lessons
at the Abbey; for Brother Stephen
had been ill for a time, and unable
to paint, and all the other monks
had colour-grinders of their own.
So Gabriel, who could not afford
to be idle even for a few days,
had been forced to seek employment
elsewhere.</p>

<p>The only work he could find
was with a leather dresser in the
village of St. Martin's, and
though it was very hard and distasteful<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
to him, he felt that he
must keep at it, as he could thus
earn a few pennies more each day
than he could as colour-grinder
at the Abbey. And yet, with all
his hard toil, the little sum he
brought home at night was far
from enough to keep them all
from want, to say nothing of paying
the tax which still hung over
them; and so every day they became
more hopeless and discouraged.</p>

<p>Indeed, in those times, when a
peasant family fell under the displeasure
of their noble lord, it
was a bitter misfortune, for there
were few places to which they
might turn for help.</p>

<p>And it seemed to Gabriel especially
hard to bear all their troubles<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
in the gracious Christmas season;
for it was now past the middle of
December. Always before they
had had enough for their happy
little Christmas feast, and some
to spare. They had always had
their sheaf of wheat put by for
the birds; and for two seasons
past Gabriel's father had let him
climb up the tall ladder and fasten
the holiday sheaf, bound with its
garland of greens, to the roof of
the little peaked and gabled dovecote
that stood on top of a carved
pole in the centre of the farmyard.
For every Norman peasant
always wishes the birds, too,
to be happy at the joyous Christmas-tide.</p>

<p>And always, every Christmas
eve, when Gabriel and his little<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
brothers and sister had gone to
bed, they had set their wooden
shoes in a row on the hearthstone;
and then in the morning when
they wakened up, they always
found that the blessed Christ-child
had been there in the night,
and filled all the little shoes with
red apples and nuts.</p>

<p>But this Christmas-time everything
was so sad and changed,
they were sure even the Christ-child
would forget them. And,
day by day, the little supply of
coarse meal for their black bread
grew smaller and smaller, and the
snow became deeper, and the wintry
winds blew more cold and
cruelly.</p>

<p>Meantime, King Louis's messenger
was travelling as fast as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
he could, and three days before
Christmas he arrived at St. Martin's
Abbey. The Abbot was
greatly surprised to see him, and
still more so when he asked if he
might speak privately with Brother
Stephen. This the Abbot granted,
though he was very anxious to
know the messenger's errand; for
he could think of no reason for it,
unless there had been something
wrong with King Louis's book.
So he was quite uneasy as he saw
the messenger enter Brother Stephen's
cell and close the door.</p>

<p>Brother Stephen, too, was at
first much surprised when his visitor
told him he had come from
King Louis to inquire about a
peasant boy by the name of Gabriel
Viaud; though in a moment<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
it flashed through his mind that
Gabriel's prayer had found its
way to the palace, and that the
answer was coming.</p>

<p>He said nothing of this, however,
but when the messenger
asked if he had had such a boy
for colour-grinder, he eagerly answered:</p>

<p>"Yes, and there lives no manlier
and sweeter-spirited lad in all
France!"</p>

<p>"Is it true," continued the messenger,
"that Count Pierre de
Bouchage hath imprisoned his
father for failure to pay a tax,
and that the family are now in
sore distress?"</p>

<p>"Yes, that also is true," replied
the monk very sadly. And then
he said beseechingly: "But surely<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
King Louis will help them?
Surely our gracious sovereign
will not allow such injustice and
cruelty?"</p>

<p>Here the messenger answered:</p>

<p>"Nay, our sovereign is indeed
a generous monarch! Else had
he not been touched by the little
prayer which the peasant lad
placed in the book thou madest
for the Lady Anne. Though I
dare say thou knewest naught of
it" (here Brother Stephen smiled
gently, but said nothing), "yet so
the lad did. And 'twas because
of that scrap of parchment falling
under the eyes of King Louis,
that I have journeyed all the way
from Paris. And," he added, as
he remembered the heavy snow
through which he had ridden, "it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
takes a stout heart and a stouter
horse to brave thy Norman roads
in December!"</p>

<p>Then he asked Brother Stephen
a great many more questions,
and inquired what road to take in
order to find Count Pierre's castle,
and also the Viaud cottage. And
then when he had satisfied himself
about all these matters, he
went back to the great hall of the
Abbey, where the Abbot was
slowly pacing the floor, telling
his beads as he walked.</p>

<p>The Abbot, though very curious
as to the reason of the
messenger's visit, asked him no
questions other than if the book
for Lady Anne had been entirely
satisfactory; and he felt relieved
when the messenger assured him<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
that so far as he knew both the
king and Lady Anne had been
greatly delighted with it. Then,
after talking a little while about
Brother Stephen's artistic work,
the messenger briefly explained
to the Abbot his errand, and told
him that King Louis had ordered
him to make his inquiries about
Gabriel as quietly as possible.</p>

<p>As he heard, the Abbot raised
his eyebrows and looked somewhat
disapproving, when he realized
that the peasant lad who had
dared to put his page into the
beautiful book was the same
little colour-grinder who had had
the boldness to speak to him, one
day in the garden, and ask him
to take off Brother Stephen's
chain. However, whatever he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
may have thought, he kept it to
himself; he treated the messenger
with much courtesy, and, on
bidding him good night, invited
him to stay as a guest of the
Abbey so long as he chose.</p>

<p>The next morning the messenger
rode to the Viaud farm, and,
though he did not go into the
cottage, he looked it over carefully
and the land about it; and
then he took the highway that led
to the castle of Count Pierre de
Bouchage.</p>

<p>When he reached the castle,
he asked to see Count Pierre, and
so was taken into the great hall,
where the count received him in
a very haughty manner. He became
somewhat more polite, however,
when he learned that King<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
Louis had sent the messenger to
him; though he looked decidedly
blank when the latter presented
to him a letter written on parchment
and fastened with a wax
seal stamped with the king's
emblem, which was the print
of a little porcupine with the
quills on his back standing up
straight, and a crown on top of
them.</p>

<p>On seeing this letter, Count
Pierre looked blank because the
truth was, that, like many other
noble lords at that time, he could
read only with great difficulty.
But then the messenger rather
expected this, and so he asked
permission to read the parchment
to him, and Count Pierre frowningly
assented.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<p>Indeed, though the messenger
pretended not to notice his angry
looks, he frowned blacker and
blacker as the reading went on.
For King Louis requested in the
letter that Count Pierre at once
release from prison in his castle
one Jacques Viaud, peasant on
his estate. And the king further
said that he himself wished
to buy the Viaud cottage and
farm, together with a good-sized
piece of ground that adjoined it
(the messenger, in looking it over
that morning, had selected a piece
of land which was much better soil
than the most of the Viaud farm),
and he stated that for this purpose
he had sent by his messenger
a certain sum in gold pieces.</p>

<p>The king mentioned also that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
he would like to have the flock of
sheep, with the addition of fifty
more than had been taken from
them, restored to the Viaud family.
And, finally, he said that he desired
Count Pierre to do these
things in honour of his king's approaching
marriage with the Lady
Anne. For when kings and
queens marry, it is generally customary
for them, and for many
of the loyal noblemen who are
their subjects, to bestow gifts and
benefits upon the poor people, so
that every one may be as happy
as possible on the royal wedding-day.</p>

<p>Now Count Pierre really did
not care a fig to do honour to
King Louis's marriage, and he
was very angry to be asked to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
release a peasant whom he had
imprisoned, and to restore flocks
which he had seized; and especially
was he furious at the request
to buy the land, for he did
not wish to sell it, and so to lose
control over the peasant-folk who
lived there.</p>

<p>But, nevertheless, in spite of
his wrath, the count knew well
enough that he had no real right
to do as he had done, and that
King Louis knew it also; and
that therefore the very best thing
he could do was to obey the
king's wishes at once.</p>

<p>King Louis had made his
letter a polite request rather than
a command, because some of his
unruly subjects, like Count Pierre,
were proud and difficult to manage,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
and he wished to settle matters
pleasantly and peaceably, if
possible. And so, in asking him
to honour the royal wedding,
he gave the count an excuse to
yield to his king's wishes, without
hurting his pride so much as
if he were obliged to obey a
command.</p>

<p>Count Pierre began to see this,
too; and, moreover, he knew that,
notwithstanding the politeness of
his letter, the king had plenty
of soldiers, and that he would not
hesitate to send them to the Castle
de Bouchage, if necessary, to bring
its lord to terms. And he very
wisely reflected that to fight King
Louis would be a much more
dangerous and expensive undertaking
than the private war with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
the Baron of Evreux, which he
already had on his hands.</p>

<p>Before yielding to the requests
in the letter, however, Count
Pierre wished to satisfy himself
that the messenger had correctly
read it to him. And so, haughtily
demanding it for a few minutes,
he hurried out of the hall, and
sent a page scampering off to
bring to him a troubadour; for
one or more of these wandering
singers were always to be found
in every nobleman's castle, and
the count knew that most of them
could read.</p>

<p>When in a few minutes the
page came back, followed, close
at his heels, by a man in motley
dress, with a viol hung over his
shoulders, Count Pierre, without<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
waiting to greet the latter, thrust
the parchment into his hands with
the gruff command:</p>

<p>"There, fellow! read this letter
for me instantly! and if thou
makest a single mistake, I will
have thee strangled with the
strings of thine own viol, and
tumbled off the highest turret
of this castle before set of
sun!"</p>

<p>At this fierce threat, the troubadour
began at once to read,
taking care to make no mistakes.
Count Pierre listened attentively
to every word, and when the troubadour
came to the end, having
read it exactly as the messenger
had done, the count angrily
snatched it from his hands, and,
swallowing his rage as best he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
could, went slowly back to the
castle hall.</p>

<p>Then, after a few moments'
silence, he very ungraciously and
ill-naturedly gave orders that peasant
Viaud be released from prison,
and the sheep sent back. He
made a very wry face over the
fifty extra ones, and did not look
at all anxious to celebrate King
Louis's approaching wedding.</p>

<p>And then he took the gold
pieces which the messenger offered
him, and reluctantly scrawled his
name (it was all he could write,
and that very badly) to a piece of
parchment which the messenger
had ready, and which, when
Count Pierre had signed it,
proved that he had sold to King
Louis the land and cottage, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
no longer held control over peasant
Viaud or any of his family.</p>

<p>When this was done, the messenger,
bidding the nobleman a
courteous farewell, left the latter
still very angry and scowling, and,
above all, lost in amazement that
King Louis should take all this
trouble on account of a poor, unknown
peasant, who had lived all
his life on a tiny farm in Normandy!
And as no one ever
explained things to him, Count
Pierre never did know how it had
all come about, and that, however
much against his will, he was doing
his part toward helping answer
Gabriel's little prayer.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X.</h2>

<h3>GABRIEL'S CHRISTMAS</h3>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 89px;">
<img src="images/drop_w.png" width="89" height="125" alt="W" title="" />
</div><div class='unindent'><br /><br />HEN the messenger
reached the courtyard of
the castle, he found peasant
Viaud awaiting him
there. The poor man looked very
pale and wan from his imprisonment,
and his face pitifully showed
what anxiety he had suffered in
thinking about his family left with
no one to help them. His clothes,
too, were thin and worn, and he
shivered in the cold December
wind. Noticing this, the messenger<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
at once sent word to Count
Pierre that he was sure King
Louis would be highly gratified,
if, in further honour of his coming
marriage, the count would supply
peasant Viaud with a warm suit
of clothes before leaving the
castle.</div>

<p>This message was almost too
much for Count Pierre to bear,
but he did not dare to refuse.
And the messenger smiled to
himself when, by and by, a page
came and called Gabriel's father
into the castle, from which, in a
little while, he came out, warmly
clad, and quite bewildered at all
that was happening to him.</p>

<p>As they set out together for
the Viaud cottage, peasant Viaud
walking, and the messenger riding<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
very slowly, the latter explained
to him all about Gabriel's little
prayer in the beautiful book, and
how Lady Anne had sent it to
King Louis, to whom he owed his
release from prison. But the messenger
added that, aside from the
lad's father and mother, the king
did not wish any one, not even
Gabriel himself, to know how it
had all come about.</p>

<p>For King Louis declared that
he himself did not deserve any
thanks, but that the good God
had only chosen the Lady Anne
and himself and Count Pierre
(though the latter did not know
it) as the means of answering
Gabriel's prayer, and of helping
the Christ-child bring happiness
at the blessed Christmas-time.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
For King Louis had not forgotten
that the great day was
near at hand.</p>

<p>Of the promised return of the
sheep, and the buying of the farm
by the king, the messenger said
nothing then; and when they had
nearly reached the cottage, he took
leave of peasant Viaud and rode
back to the Abbey. For, having
finished the king's errand, before
going away, he wanted to say
good-bye to the Abbot and
brothers of St. Martin's, and also
to get some of his belongings
which he had left at the Abbey.</p>

<p>A few minutes after the messenger
had left him, peasant Viaud
reached the cottage and raised the
latch,&mdash;but then it is no use trying
to tell how surprised and happy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
they all were! how they hugged
and kissed each other, and laughed
and cried!</p>

<p>And then, when the first excitement
was over, they began soberly
to wonder what they would do
next; for they still feared the displeasure
of Count Pierre, and still
did not know where to turn to
raise the tax, or to help their
poverty.</p>

<p>"If only he had not taken the
sheep," said Gabriel's mother,
sadly, "at least I could have spun
warm clothes for all of us!"</p>

<p>But even as she spoke, a loud
"Baa! Baa!" sounded from up
the road, and presently along came
a large flock of sheep followed by
one of Count Pierre's shepherds,
who, without saying a word to any<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
one, skilfully guided them into the
Viaud sheepfold, and there safely
penned them in; then, still without
a word, he turned about and
went off in the direction of the
castle.</p>

<p>Gabriel's father and mother,
who from the cottage window had
watched all this in silent amazement,
looked at each other, too
bewildered to speak. Then they
went out together to the sheepfold,
and peasant Viaud, who
began to realize that this, too,
must be part of King Louis's
orders, explained to his wife that
which the messenger had told him.
When he had finished, they went
back, hand in hand, to the house,
their eyes filled with happy tears,
and in their hearts a great tenderness<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
for the little son who had
brought help to them.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 315px;">
<img src="images/i023.jpg" width="315" height="400" alt="&quot;He passed a little peasant boy&quot;" title="" />
<span class="caption">&quot;<i>He passed a little peasant boy</i>&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>Just before dark, that same
afternoon, the king's messenger,
having taken leave of the Abbey
folk, once more passed along the
highroad. On his way, he was
particular to stop at the Viaud
cottage, where he contrived to
have a few minutes' talk alone
with Gabriel's mother, and then
wishing her a merry Christmas,
he spurred his horse, and rode
along on his journey back to
Paris.</p>

<p>As he neared St. Martin's village,
he passed a little peasant
boy, in a worn blouse, walking
toward the country; and had he
known that this same lad was the
Gabriel because of whom, at King<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
Louis's order, he had ridden all
the way from Paris, he would certainly
have looked at the boy with
keen interest.</p>

<p>While for his part, had Gabriel
known that the strange horseman
was a messenger from the
king, and that he had that day
played a very important part in
the affairs of the Viaud family,&mdash;had
he known this,&mdash;he surely
would have stood stock-still and
opened his eyes wide with amazement!</p>

<p>But the messenger was absorbed
in his own thoughts, and
so rode swiftly on; while poor
Gabriel was too sad and wretched
to pay much attention to any one.</p>

<p>As the lad drew near home,
however, all at once he fancied he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
heard the bleating of sheep. At
this he pricked up his ears and
began to run, his heart suddenly
beating very fast with excitement!</p>

<p>When he reached the sheepfold,
sure enough, there was no
mistaking the sounds within. He
opened the door and hurried
through the thatched shed, noting
with delight the rows of woolly
backs glistening in the twilight,
and then, bursting into the cottage,
rushed up to his father and
kissed and hugged him with all
his might!</p>

<p>Indeed, Gabriel was so happy
and excited that he did not realize
that he was not at all surprised
with their good fortune.
For miserable as he had been for
weeks, and though he had thought<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
that he had quite despaired of his
prayer being answered, yet deep
down in his heart, without knowing
it, all the while he had cherished a
strong hope that it would be.</p>

<p>Nor was Brother Stephen surprised
either, when, at barely daybreak
the next morning, before
going to his work, Gabriel hurried
up to the Abbey and told
him all about it. His face beamed
with delight, however, and he
seemed almost as happy over it
all as Gabriel himself. He smiled,
too, but said nothing, as the lad
wondered over and over what
God had done to Count Pierre,
to make him willing to free his
father and restore the sheep! He
only said, as he gently patted Gabriel's
hair:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>

<p>"There, there, little one! the
good God hath many ways of
softening men's hearts, and never
thou mind in what manner he
hath chosen to manage the Count
Pierre!"</p>

<p>Just then one of the monks
went past the open door, his arms
full of evergreens, and carrying in
his hand a pot of the pretty white
flowers that the Norman peasant
folk call Christmas roses. Seeing
him, Brother Stephen told Gabriel
that he must go and help the
brothers trim the Abbey church
for the joyous service of the morrow;
and so with another affectionate
little pat, he went out to
do his part in arranging the holiday
greens and garlands and tall
wax candles, while Gabriel hurried<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
off to his work in the village.</p>

<p>The little boy was so happy,
though, over the things that had
happened at home, that he went
about all day in a sort of wondering
dream. And that evening as
he went home from his work, very
tired, but still dreaming, the early
Christmas-eve stars shone and
twinkled so radiantly over his
head and the snow sparkled so
brightly under his feet, that he
fairly tingled through and through
with the nameless, magic happiness
of the blessed season!</p>

<p>And when he reached home,
and sat down next to his father
while they ate their scanty supper,
they all felt so glad to be together
again that nobody minded that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
the pieces of black bread were
smaller than ever, and that when
the cold wind blew through the
crevices of the cottage walls, there
was not enough fire on the hearth
to keep them from shivering.</p>

<p>Indeed, they were all so much
happier than they had been for
many weeks, that when Gabriel
and the younger children went to
bed, the latter, with many little
gurgles of laughter, arranged their
little wooden shoes on the hearth,
just as they had always done on
Christmas eve.</p>

<p>For they said to each other,
Jean, and Margot, and little Guillaume,
that surely the good God
had not forgotten them after all!
Had he not brought back their
father and the sheep? And surely<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
he would tell the little Christ-child
to bring them a few Christmas
apples and nuts!</p>

<p>Gabriel, however, took no part
in their talk, and he did not set
his shoes on the hearth with the
others; not that he feared they
would be forgotten, but rather
because he thought that he had
already asked for so much and
been so generously answered, that
he had had his share of Christmas
happiness.</p>

<p>His father was freed from
prison, and the flock of sheep,
with fifty more than they had had
before, were back in the fold;
and though they were not yet relieved
from the tax, nor was their
land restored to them, as he had
prayed, yet he felt sure that these,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
too, would come about in some
way.</p>

<p>And so, considering all these
things, he did not quite like to set
out his wooden shoes, and thus
invite the Christ-child to give him
more; for he knew the Christ-child
had a great many shoes to
attend to that night. So Gabriel,
as he made himself ready for bed,
pretended not to hear the chatter of
his little brothers and sister, nor
to notice what they were doing.</p>

<p>When peasant Viaud, however,
saw them standing their little
empty shoes in front of the
meagre fire, he bowed his head on
his hands, and the tears trickled
through his fingers. But the
mother smiled softly to herself, as
she kissed each of the children<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
and tucked them into their worn
sheepskin covers.</p>

<p>Next morning, at the first peep
of day, every one in the cottage
was wide awake; and as soon as
they opened their eyes, the children
all jumped out of bed and
ran to the hearth with little
screams of delight. For there
stood the little wooden shoes,&mdash;Gabriel's,
too, though he had not
put them there,&mdash;and even a
larger one apiece for the father
and mother, and the blessed
Christ-child had not forgotten one!</p>

<p>Only instead of apples and
nuts, they were filled with the
most wonderful bonbons; strange
sugar birds, and animals, and candied
fruits such as no peasant
child in Normandy had ever before<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
seen; for they were sweetmeats
that no one but the cooks of
old Paris knew just how to make.</p>

<p>And then, as with eager fingers
the children drew out these marvels,
down in the toe of each shoe
they found a little porcupine of
white sugar with pink quills tipped
with a tiny, gilded, candy crown;
and last of all, after each little
porcupine, out tumbled a shining
yellow gold piece stamped with
the likeness of King Louis.</p>

<p>Even the larger shoes were filled
with bonbons, too, and from the
toe of the mother's out dropped a
gold piece, like the others, only
larger. But when the father, with
clumsy hands, emptied his shoe,
instead of a gold piece, there fell
out a small parchment roll fastened<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
with a silken cord, and showing
at one corner a wax seal bearing
the print of the little royal porcupine
and crown.</p>

<p>Peasant Viaud gazed at it for
a few minutes, in utter bewilderment,
and then handing it to Gabriel,
who was standing by, he said:</p>

<p>"Here, child, 'tis a bit of writing,
and thou art the only one of
us who can read. See if Brother
Stephen's lessons have taken thee
far enough to make out the meaning
of this!"</p>

<p>Gabriel took the roll and eagerly
untied the cord, and then he carefully
spelled out every word of
the writing, which was signed by
Count Pierre de Bouchage.</p>

<p>For it was the very same parchment
which King Louis's messenger<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
had made Count Pierre
sign to prove that he had sold
to the king, for a certain sum of
gold, the old Viaud farm, together
with a piece of good land adjoining
it; and then, at the end of the
deed, as the writing was called,
there were a few lines from King
Louis himself, which said that in
honour of the blessed Christmas-time
the king took pleasure in
presenting to peasant Viaud, and
his heirs for ever, everything that
he had bought from Count Pierre.</p>

<p>When Gabriel had finished
reading, no one spoke for a little
while; it was so hard to realize
the crowning good fortune that
had befallen them. Peasant Viaud
looked fairly dazed, and the mother
laughed and cried as she snatched<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
Gabriel to her and kissed him
again and again. The younger
children did not understand what
it all meant, and so went on
munching their sweetmeats without
paying much attention to the
little piece of parchment which
Gabriel still held in his hand.</p>

<p>As for Gabriel, he really had
had no idea that any one could
possibly be so happy as he himself
was at that moment! He had
not the least notion of how it had
all come about; he only knew
that his heart was fairly bursting
with gratitude to the dear God
who had answered his little prayer
so much more joyously and wonderfully
than he had ever dared
to dream of!</p>

<p>In his excitement he ran out of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
the house and hurried into the
sheepfold, where he patted the soft
woolly backs of each of the sheep,
and then he raced around the
snowy meadows trying to realize
that all these belonged to his
family for ever! And that Count
Pierre could never again imprison
his father or worry him with
heavy taxes!</p>

<p>But the wonders of this wonderful
day were not yet over; for
presently, as Gabriel raised his
eyes, he saw a strange horseman
coming down the road and looking
inquiringly in the direction of the
Viaud cottage. Then seeing the boy
standing in the meadow, the horseman
called out:</p>

<p>"Ho, lad! Is this the farm of
the peasant Viaud?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, sir," answered Gabriel,
coming up to the road; and then,</p>

<p>"Art thou Gabriel?" asked the
rider, stopping and looking curiously
at the little boy.</p>

<p>When again Gabriel wonderingly
answered, "Yes, sir," the
stranger dismounted, and, after
tying his horse, began deliberately
unfastening the two fat saddle-bags
hanging over the back of the
latter; and loading himself with
as much as he could carry, he
gave Gabriel an armful, too, and
walked toward the cottage.</p>

<p>To the surprised looks and
questions of Gabriel's father and
mother, he only said that the
Christ-child had been in the castle
of the Lady Anne of Bretagne,
and had ordered him to bring<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
certain things to the family of a
Norman peasant boy named Gabriel
Viaud.</p>

<p>And such delightful things as
they were! There was a great
roll of thick, soft blue cloth, so
that they could all be warmly clad
without waiting for the mother to
spin the wool from the sheeps'
backs. There were nice little
squirrel-fur caps for all the children;
there were more yellow
gold pieces; and then there was
a large package of the most enchanting
sweetmeats, such as the
Bretons make at Christmas-time;
little "magi-cakes," as they were
called, each cut in the shape of
a star and covered with spices and
sugar; curious old-fashioned candies
and sugared chestnuts; and a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
pretty basket filled with small
round loaves of the fine, white
bread of Bretagne; only instead of
the ordinary baking, these loaves
were of a special holiday kind,
with raisins, and nuts, and dried
sweet-locust blossoms sprinkled
over the top.</p>

<p>Indeed, perhaps never before
had so marvellous a feast been
spread under a peasant roof in
Normandy! All were beside
themselves with delight; and while
the younger children were dancing
round and round in happy bewilderment,
Gabriel snatched up a
basket, and hurriedly filling it
with some of the choicest of
the sweetmeats, started off at a
brisk run for the Abbey; for he
wanted to share some of his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
Christmas happiness with Brother
Stephen.</p>

<p>When he reached the Abbey,
his eyes bright with excitement,
and his cheeks rosy from the crisp
cold air, and poured out to Brother
Stephen the story of their fresh
good fortune, the monk laughed
with delight, and felt that he, too,
was having the happiest Christmas
he had ever known.</p>

<p>And then, by and by, when he
took Gabriel by the hand and led
him into the Abbey church for the
beautiful Christmas service, as the
little boy knelt on the stone floor
and gazed around at the lovely garlands
of green, and the twinkling
candles and white Christmas roses
on the altar, half-hidden by the
clouds of fragrant incense that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
floated up from the censers the
little acolytes were swinging to
and fro,&mdash;as he listened to the
glorious music from the choir, and
above all, as he thought of how
the dear God had answered his
prayer, the tears sprang to his
eyes from very joy and gratitude!
And perhaps that Christmas
morning no one in all France,
not even King Louis himself, was
quite so happy as the little peasant
boy, Gabriel Viaud.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI.</h2>

<h3>THE KING'S ILLUMINATOR</h3>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 83px;">
<img src="images/drop_a.png" width="83" height="125" alt="A" title="" />
</div><div class='unindent'><br /><br />ND to say that he was
happier than even King
Louis, is saying a very
great deal; for King
Louis spent the day most delightfully
in Bretagne, in the castle of
his bride to be, the Lady Anne.
And then, just after the holiday
season had passed, early in January,
he and Lady Anne were
married with great ceremony and
splendour.</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>

<p>After the wedding, for three
months, the king and queen lingered
in Bretagne; enjoying themselves
by night with magnificent
entertainments in the castle, and
by day in riding over the frosty
fields and in hunting, of which
both of them were very fond.
And then in April, when the first
hawthorn buds were beginning
to break, they journeyed down
to Paris to live in the king's
palace.</p>

<p>Before long, King Louis and
Queen Anne decided to make a
number of improvements in this
palace; and as they both were
great lovers of beautiful books,
they determined, among other
things, to build a large writing-room
where they could have skilful<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
illuminators always at work
making lovely books for them.</p>

<p>When this room was finished,
and they began to think of whom
they would employ, the first one
they spoke of was Brother Stephen,
whose exquisite work on the book
of hours had so delighted them.
But then, much as they wished to
have him in the palace, they did
not think it possible to do so, as
they knew he belonged to the
brotherhood of St. Martin's Abbey,
and so of course had taken
vows to spend his whole life there.</p>

<p>It chanced, however, soon after
this, that King Louis happened
to have a little talk with the messenger
he had sent to the Abbey
at Christmas time to see about Gabriel.
And this messenger told the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
king that while there the Abbot,
in speaking to him of Brother
Stephen's work, had said that the
latter really wished to leave the
brotherhood and go into the world
to paint; and that, though he had
refused his request to be freed
from his vows, yet the monk had
worked so faithfully at King
Louis's book that he thought he
had earned his freedom, and that
perhaps he, the Abbot, had done
wrong in forcing him to stay at
the Abbey if he wished to study
his art elsewhere.</p>

<p>In short, he had as much as
said that if Brother Stephen ever
again asked for his freedom, he
would grant it; and this showed
that the Abbot had relented and
unbent a great deal more than any<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
one could ever have believed possible.</p>

<p>When King Louis heard what
the messenger told him, he was
greatly pleased; and after talking
it over with the queen, he decided
to send the same messenger
post-haste back to the Abbey to
ask for the services of Brother
Stephen before the Abbot might
again change his mind.</p>

<p>Now King Louis was a very
liberal monarch, and both he and
Queen Anne liked nothing better
than to encourage and help along
real artists. And so they thought
that they would supply Brother
Stephen with money so that he
could travel about and study and
paint as he chose, even if he preferred
always to paint larger pictures<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
rather than to illuminate
books; though they hoped that
once in awhile he might spend a
little time in their fine new writing-room.</p>

<p>When the messenger started,
they told him to explain all this
to Brother Stephen, and let the
latter plan his work in whatever
way best pleased him.</p>

<p>But the queen gave particular
orders that, if possible, the messenger
was to bring the peasant
boy, Gabriel Viaud, back to the
palace with him; for she thought
the lad's work on the page where
he had written his little prayer
showed such promise that she
wished to see him, and to have
him continue his training in the
beautiful art of illumination.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>

<p>The messenger, having thus
received his orders, at once set
out again for Normandy; and he
found this second journey much
more pleasant than the one he had
made before, through the winter
snows. For this time he rode
under tall poplar-trees and between
green hedgerows, where the
cuckoos and fieldfares sang all
day long. And when, after several
days' travelling, he drew near
St. Martin's Abbey, the country
on either side of the road was
pink with wild roses and meadowsweet,
just as it had been a year
before, when Gabriel used to
gather the clusters of field-flowers
for Brother Stephen to paint in
the beautiful book.</p>

<p>Indeed, Gabriel still gathered<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
the wild flowers every day, but
only because he loved them; for
though, since their better fortunes,
he was again studying and working
with Brother Stephen, the
latter was then busy on a long
book of monastery rules, with only
here and there a coloured initial
letter, and which altogether was
not nearly so interesting as had
been the book of hours with its
lovely painted borders.</p>

<p>And so when the messenger
reached the Abbey, and made
known his errand, they were both
overjoyed at the prospect King
Louis offered them.</p>

<p>After talking with the messenger,
the Abbot, true to his
word, in a solemn ceremony, freed
Brother Stephen from his vows<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
of obedience to the rules of St.
Martin's brotherhood; and then
he gave both him and Gabriel
his blessing.</p>

<p>Brother Stephen, who had been
too proud to ask a second time
for his freedom, was now delighted
that it had all come about in the
way it did, and that he could
devote his time to painting anything
he chose.</p>

<p>Gabriel, too, was enchanted at
the thought of all that he could
do and learn in the king's palace;
and though he felt it hard to leave
his home, Queen Anne had kindly
made it easier for him by promising
that sometimes he might come
back for a little visit.</p>

<p>So in a few days he and Brother
Stephen had made all their preparations<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
to leave; and they set
out, Gabriel going with the messenger
directly to King Louis's
palace in Paris; while Brother
Stephen, taking the bag of gold
pieces which the king and queen
had sent for him, travelled to
many of the great cities of Europe,
where he studied the wonderful
paintings of the world's most
famous masters, and where he
himself made many beautiful pictures.
In this way he spent a
number of happy months.</p>

<p>And then, just as a great many
other people do, who find out that
as soon as they are not compelled
to do a certain kind of work, they
really like it very much better than
they thought, so, Brother Stephen,
being no longer obliged to illuminate<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
books, all at once discovered
that he really enjoyed painting
them more than anything else
in the world.</p>

<p>And so it was that, by and by,
to the gratification of the king and
queen, and above all to the great
delight of Gabriel, he made his
way to the great writing-room of
the palace in Paris. And there,
in the doing of his exquisite artistic
work, he passed the rest of his
long and happy life.</p>

<p>And through all the years the
warm love and friendship between
himself and Gabriel was as sweet
and beautiful and as unchanging
as any of the white and golden
lilies that they painted in their
rarest books. For Gabriel, too,
became one of the finest illuminators<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
of the time, and his work
was much sought for by the great
nobles of the land.</p>

<p>Indeed, to this day, many of
the wonderful illuminations that
were made in that writing-room
are still carefully kept in the great
libraries and museums of France
and of Europe. And some time,
if ever you have the happiness
to visit one of these, and are there
shown some of the painted books
from the palace of King Louis
XII. and Queen Anne, if the
work is especially lovely, you may
be quite certain that either Brother
Stephen, or Gabriel, or perhaps
both of them together, had a hand
in its making.</p>
